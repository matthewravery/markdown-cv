## Professional Experience

#### Institute for Defense Analyses, Alexandria, VA
`2018 – Present` __Embedded Analyst, Office of Cost Analysis and Program Evaluation (CAPE)__

Provide analytical support to OSD(CAPE). Perform original data analysis and organize ad hoc teams of IDA researchers to address special requests from CAPE staff. 

`2017 – Present` __Task Leader, Tactical Aerial Reconnaissance Systems (TARS)__

Manage $300k line of effort providing analysis on unmanned aircraft systems. Coordinate work of nine IDA researchers to provide the Office of the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation input on six Programs of Record. Tasks include budget planning, organizing coverage plans for test events, and quality control of team products. 

`2012 – 2016` __Research Staff Member__

Provided analytical support to the Office of the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation on over twenty DoD Programs of Record. Products included planning and design of operational tests, observing test events, data analysis, and report writing.

#### North Carolina State University, Raleigh NC

`2012 – 2016` __Teaching Assistant__

Sole instructor for introductory and second-semester statistics courses for non-majors (five total semesters). Prepared and presented lectures, produced in-class activities, provided one-on-one instruction to students, prepared and graded exams.

#### Merscom/Playdom, Chapel Hill NC

`2009-2010` __Business Analytics Specialist (Internship)__

Provided direct analytical support to Merscom chief executives (and Chapel Hill office leadership post-acquisition by Playdom). Tracked game play metrics and provided daily reports to leadership monitoring trends including re-visit rates and uptake. 

##Teaching

#### North Carolina State University, 2007 - 2012

`2012-2011` __ST 312: Introduction to Statistics II__
Material includes multiple linear regression, one- and two-way ANOVA, multiple comparisons, and other topics. Responsibilities included preparing lectures, designing in-class activities, and writing exams. 

`2008-2011`  __ST 311: Introduction to Statistics I__
Material includes hypothesis testing for means and proportions, confidence intervals, sampling, introduction to regression and other topics. Responsibilities included preparing lectures, designing in-class activities, and writing midterm exams.

##Short Courses and Tutorials

`Multiple` __Design of Experiments - DOT&E Action Officer Training__

`Multiple` __Reliability Test Planning - DOT&E Action Officer Training__

Multiple instructors help to build and present sections of these full-day courses, which are delivered once or twice annually to Action Officers working for the Office of the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation. Author and presenter responsibilities vary from year to year. Relevant sections include Experimental Designs; Data Analysis Overview; Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability (RAM) Requirements; and Analysis of RAM Data.

`April 2016` __Bootstrapping 101 - Science of Test Workshop__

Half-day tutorial covering populations and sampling, sampling distributions, statistical inference, resampling, the “bootstrap world”, confidence intervals for simple and complex statistics, hypothesis testing, and further extensions. 

`July 2014` __Maximum Likelihood Estimation - Institute for Defense Analyses__

Half-day course covering estimation and properties of MLEs, multi-parameter MLEs, censoring and transformations, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, Fisher Information, and the delta method.
